## online
this app WILL NOT have a server because:
- quite frankly i can't afford to rent a server for two and a half people who will use the app
-  i don't want to expose my ip by hosting on my own server
-  privacy concerns,  you don't want your data about a weird (but sexy as hell :з) kink to be stored somewhere, do you?
-   you will be able to use this app with your dom/friends/sub forever, without the dooming "servers will be dead one day"
-  p2p is free and all you need is to connect straight to the other person/people pc(s)
